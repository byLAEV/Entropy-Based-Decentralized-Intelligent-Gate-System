# Entropy-Based-Decentralized-Intelligent-Gate-System
Hanbot Gatekeepers is a decentralized access control system based on entropy. It uses intelligent gates managed by AI agents that randomly select entry and exit routes, ensuring unpredictability, security, and resistance to external manipulation in decentralized environments.

Abstract

This system introduces a non-deterministic entry and exit mechanism for decentralized banking infrastructure, based on entropy principles and governed by AI agents acting as intelligent gatekeepers. It aims to ensure security, non-predictability, and dynamic routing of data requests through multi-path channels, mitigating surveillance, censorship, and centralized control.

Purpose

To establish a decentralized gateway model where AI agents autonomously and unpredictably manage the flow of inbound and outbound interactions without fixed paths, thereby reinforcing privacy and entropy in the execution and distribution of requests.

Key Components

1. Entropy Engine

A non-linear, pseudorandom entropy model governs the selection of pathways for data flow. This engine eliminates fixed routing and injects unpredictability into the network's decision-making processes.

2. Hanbot AI Gatekeepers

AI agents (Hanbots) serve as autonomous gatekeepers. Each gatekeeper operates independently and anonymously to decide:

Which request enters

From where it enters

Where and how it exits
These decisions are encrypted, isolated, and never stored in a traceable form.


3. Decentralized Multi-Gate Architecture

Multiple entry/exit gates operate simultaneously. Each interaction passes through an AI-regulated gate selected at random by the entropy engine. No central authority can predict or intercept the flow.

4. Gate Permission System

Requests to interact with the system must pass a permission layer that includes validation, digital signature verification, and alignment with smart contract logic. Unauthorized or suspicious requests are redirected or denied.

5. Integration with BIOS and Request Blockchain

An alternate subsystem based on BIOS-initiated requests is implemented for communication with legacy institutions. Outbound activity from the system is recorded on a private, process-specific blockchain acting as a log of requests, approvals, and responses.
